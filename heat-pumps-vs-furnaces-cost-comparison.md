# Heat Pumps vs. Furnaces vs. Oil: Real Maryland Cost Comparison
## What it actually costs to heat your home—no marketing BS, just math

Every heat pump sales pitch includes some version of: "You'll save thousands per year!"

Every furnace company says: "Natural gas is the cheapest way to heat."

Every oil company warns: "Don't believe the heat pump hype."

Here's what nobody does: Show you the actual math for your specific situation.

This article fixes that. We're going to break down real costs for a typical Maryland home, include all the variables that actually matter, and show you exactly what you'd pay with each heating option.

No cherry-picked scenarios. No "up to" savings that assume perfect conditions. Just honest numbers.

## The Test Case: A Real Maryland Home

To make this useful, we need a specific example. Here's our baseline:

**House specs:**
* 2,000 square feet
* Built in 1975 (typical pre-energy-crisis construction)
* Moderately insulated after basic weatherization (R-38 attic, sealed air leaks)
* Located in Montgomery County
* 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms
* Family of 4

**Current heating:** Oil furnace, 80% efficiency, installed 2003

**Annual heating need:** ~60 million BTUs (typical for this house size and insulation level in Maryland climate)

Now let's compare the options.

## Option 1: Keep the Old Oil Furnace

**Equipment:**
* Existing oil furnace (no new purchase needed)
* 80% efficient (older units)
* Assumes furnace still has 3-5 years of life left

**Annual oil consumption:**
* 60 million BTUs needed ÷ 80% efficiency = 75 million BTUs of oil burned
* Oil contains ~138,500 BTUs per gallon
* 75,000,000 ÷ 138,500 = **542 gallons per year**

**Fuel costs (2024-2025 Maryland averages):**
* Heating oil: $3.80-4.20/gallon (let's use $4.00)
* 542 gallons × $4.00 = **$2,168/year**

**Maintenance:**
* Annual service: $200-250
* Nozzle/filter replacement: $150 every 2-3 years (average $60/year)
* Unexpected repairs: $200/year average
* **Total maintenance: ~$460/year**

**Total annual cost: $2,628**

But wait—there's more:

**Oil price volatility risk:**
* Oil hit $6.00/gallon in winter 2022-2023
* At $6.00/gallon: 542 gallons = **$3,252/year** in fuel alone
* You have zero control over this

**ZEHES mandate:**
* By 2029, you must convert away from oil
* Your 2003 furnace might die before then anyway
* You're facing mandatory replacement within 5 years

**Environmental/safety:**
* Tank leak risk (environmental cleanup can cost $20,000-50,000+)
* CO poisoning risk if heat exchanger cracks
* Soot, smell, delivery truck noise

**Verdict:** This is the "do nothing" option. It's fine until it isn't. You're on borrowed time and at the mercy of oil prices.

## Option 2: Convert to Natural Gas Furnace

**Equipment costs:**
* 95% AFUE gas furnace: $3,500-5,000 (equipment)
* Installation labor: $2,500-4,000
* Gas line installation: $1,500-3,000 (if not already connected)
* Remove oil tank: $500-1,500
* **Total upfront: $8,000-13,500**

**Annual gas consumption:**
* 60 million BTUs needed ÷ 95% efficiency = 63.2 million BTUs of gas
* Natural gas contains ~100,000 BTUs per therm
* 63,200,000 ÷ 100,000 = **632 therms per year**

**Fuel costs (Washington Gas/BGE 2024-2025 rates):**
* Natural gas: $1.10-1.40/therm average (includes delivery charges)
* Using $1.25/therm: 632 therms × $1.25 = **$790/year**

**Maintenance:**
* Annual service: $150-200
* Occasional repairs: $100/year average
* **Total maintenance: ~$250/year**

**Total annual cost: $1,040**

**Savings vs. oil: $1,588/year**

**Payback on $10,000 investment: 6.3 years**

**The catches:**

**Not everyone has gas access:**
* Many Maryland neighborhoods don't have gas lines
* Extending gas line to your street: $10,000-50,000+ (usually not feasible)
* If gas isn't already on your street, this option doesn't exist

**Gas prices are also volatile:**
* Spiked in winter 2021-2022
* Less volatile than oil, but not fixed
* Still a fossil fuel with long-term regulatory risk

**Doesn't solve cooling:**
* You still need separate AC
* Still have two systems to maintain

**Still combustion:**
* CO risk (lower than oil, but exists)
* Requires venting, fresh air supply
* Heat exchanger can crack over time

**Verdict:** If you have gas access, this is cheaper than oil and more stable. But you're still burning fossil fuels, you still need separate AC, and you're not ZEHES-compliant (though gas furnaces aren't banned by ZEHES like oil is).

## Option 3: Electric Resistance Heat (Baseboard/Wall Heaters)

**Equipment costs:**
* Baseboard heaters for 2,000 sq ft: $3,000-6,000 (equipment + installation)
* Or keep existing ductwork, install electric furnace: $4,000-7,000

**Annual electricity consumption:**
* 60 million BTUs needed ÷ 100% efficiency = 60 million BTUs
* 60,000,000 BTUs ÷ 3,412 BTUs/kWh = **17,584 kWh/year**

**Electricity costs (Pepco/BGE 2024-2025 rates):**
* $0.13-0.15/kWh average (including delivery charges)
* Using $0.14/kWh: 17,584 × $0.14 = **$2,462/year**

**Maintenance:**
* Essentially zero (no moving parts, no combustion)
* Maybe $50/year for occasional thermostat replacement

**Total annual cost: $2,512**

Comparable to oil, slightly cheaper.

**The problems:**

**Efficiency is terrible:**
* 100% efficient sounds good, but electricity is expensive
* You're converting expensive electricity directly to heat
* No leverage, no efficiency gain

**Comfort issues:**
* Baseboard heat creates hot/cold spots
* Uneven temperature distribution
* No air circulation

**Still need separate AC:**
* Two systems to maintain
* Higher total equipment cost

**Electricity rate risk:**
* Rates have increased 30% over last decade
* Data center expansion driving infrastructure costs
* Rate increases are coming (we'll cover this in detail in a future article)

**Verdict:** Simple, reliable, but expensive to operate and getting more expensive every year. Not a smart long-term choice.

## Option 4: Air-Source Heat Pump (The ZEHES Solution)

**Equipment costs:**
* Cold-climate heat pump system: $10,000-16,000 (equipment + installation)
* Assumes ducted system using existing ductwork
* Includes both heating and cooling (replaces furnace + AC)

**Annual electricity consumption:**
* Heat pump HSPF: 10-12 (we'll use 10 for conservative estimate)
* HSPF = BTUs of heat per watt-hour of electricity
* 60 million BTUs ÷ 10 = 6 million watt-hours = **6,000 kWh/year**

**Electricity costs:**
* 6,000 kWh × $0.14/kWh = **$840/year** for heating

But heat pump also provides cooling (replaces AC):
* Typical Maryland AC usage: 1,500-2,500 kWh/year
* Heat pump cooling at SEER 16-18: 1,200-2,000 kWh/year
* Let's say 1,500 kWh × $0.14 = $210/year for cooling

**Total annual cost: $1,050** (heating + cooling combined)

**Maintenance:**
* Annual service: $150-200
* Occasional repairs: $100/year average
* **Total maintenance: ~$250/year**

**Total annual operating cost: $1,300**

**Comparison to oil:**
* Oil: $2,628/year (heating only, still need separate AC)
* Heat pump: $1,300/year (heating + cooling)
* **Savings: $1,328/year**

Plus you're eliminating separate AC costs:
* If old AC costs $200/year to run: Additional $200 savings
* **Total savings vs. oil + AC: ~$1,528/year**

**Payback on $13,000 investment: 8.5 years**

But wait—add the incentives:

**Federal tax credit (2024-2025):**
* 30% of equipment + installation cost
* $13,000 × 30% = **$3,900 credit**

**MEA EmPOWER rebates (varies by utility):**
* Pepco/BGE/Delmarva: $500-1,000 depending on efficiency
* Let's say $750

**Total incentives: $4,650**

**Net cost after incentives: $8,350**

**New payback: 5.5 years**

After payback, you're saving $1,528/year indefinitely.

## The Side-by-Side Comparison Table

| System | Upfront Cost | After Incentives | Annual Cost | 10-Year Total | Notes |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Keep Oil | $0 | $0 | $2,628 | $26,280 | Must replace by 2029, price volatility |
| Natural Gas | $10,000 | $10,000 | $1,040 | $20,400 | Only if gas available, still need AC |
| Electric Resistance | $5,000 | $5,000 | $2,512 | $30,120 | Simple but expensive, need separate AC |
| Heat Pump | $13,000 | $8,350 | $1,300 | $21,350 | Heating + cooling, ZEHES compliant |

## The Honest Truth About "Savings"

Marketing claims say: "Save $2,000/year with a heat pump!"

**Reality:**

Your savings depend on:
* What you're replacing (oil vs. gas vs. electric)
* Current fuel prices (volatile)
* How well your home is insulated (massive variable)
* How efficiently you use the system (thermostat settings, zone control)
* Electricity rates in your area (and how fast they increase)

**Best-case savings** (poorly insulated home, replacing oil):
* $2,000-2,500/year

**Typical savings** (average home, replacing oil):
* $1,300-1,800/year

**Worst-case "savings"** (well-insulated home, replacing efficient gas):
* $200-500/year (still saves, but not dramatic)

The real value isn't always dollar savings. It's:

1. **Compliance** (ZEHES mandates oil conversion by 2029)
2. **Comfort** (better temperature control, dehumidification)
3. **Convenience** (no oil deliveries, one system for heat + AC)
4. **Risk reduction** (no tank leaks, no price spikes, no CO risk)
5. **Future-proofing** (ready for solar integration, grid changes)

## The Variables That Change Everything

**Electricity rates:**
If Pepco rates increase 40% over next 10 years (realistic given data center expansion):
* Heat pump costs go from $1,300/year to $1,820/year
* Still beats oil (which also increases), but gap narrows
* This is why solar + battery matters

**Oil prices:**
If oil drops to $2.50/gallon (happened in 2020):
* Oil costs drop to $1,355/year
* Suddenly competitive with heat pump

If oil spikes to $6.00/gallon (happened in 2022):
* Oil costs jump to $3,252/year
* Heat pump savings become massive

You're betting on future energy prices either way.

The question is: Which bet do you want to make?

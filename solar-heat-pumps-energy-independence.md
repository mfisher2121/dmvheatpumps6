# Solar + Heat Pumps: How to Actually Eliminate Your Energy Bills
## The complete guide to energy independence in Maryland

Here's what the solar industry won't tell you upfront:

Adding solar panels to your roof without first addressing your energy consumption is like buying a Ferrari to commute in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

Sure, it works. But you're not using it properly.

Here's what the heat pump industry won't tell you:

Installing a heat pump without solar means you're still 100% dependent on Pepco/BGE/Dominion rates—which are about to skyrocket because of data center expansion in Ashburn.

You saved money vs. oil. But you're still vulnerable to electricity price spikes.

The real opportunity is combining both:

**Heat pump eliminates fossil fuel dependency.**

**Solar eliminates grid dependency.**

**Battery eliminates time-of-use rate manipulation.**

Together, they create actual energy independence.

This article covers:
* How to size solar for heat pump loads (don't overbuy, don't underbuy)
* Battery strategies (LiFePO4 deep dive for the car-living veterans)
* Net metering reality in Maryland
* Complete incentive stack ($20,000-30,000 in credits/rebates available)
* Real costs, real payback, real independence

Let's build the system that outlives the problems.

## Understanding Your Energy Consumption First

Most people do this backwards:

1. Call solar company
2. Get quote for "10 kW system" or whatever salesperson recommends
3. Install panels
4. Wonder why bills didn't drop as much as promised

**The right approach:**

1. **Reduce consumption** (weatherization, efficient appliances)
2. **Electrify heating** (heat pump replaces gas/oil)
3. **Size solar** to match new electric load
4. **Add battery** to store excess and provide backup

Why this order matters:

If you size solar based on your current gas heating + electric usage, then switch to heat pump later, your solar array might not be big enough.

If you install solar before weatherizing, you're paying to generate electricity that's being wasted through air leaks.

**Do it right: Weatherization → Heat Pump → Solar → Battery**

## Sizing Solar for Heat Pump Loads

Here's the actual math for a typical 2,000 sq ft Maryland home:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Electric Load

**Current electric usage (before heat pump):**
* Lighting, appliances, etc.: 8,000 kWh/year
* AC (if you have it): 2,000 kWh/year
* **Total: 10,000 kWh/year**

**After adding heat pump:**
* Heating: 6,000 kWh/year (replaces oil/gas)
* Cooling: 1,500 kWh/year (more efficient than old AC)
* Other loads: 8,000 kWh/year (unchanged)
* **New total: 15,500 kWh/year**

This is what you need solar to cover.

### Step 2: Calculate Solar Production

**Maryland solar production averages:**
* 1 kW of solar = ~1,200-1,300 kWh/year
* Varies by roof orientation, shading, tilt angle
* South-facing roof: Best production
* East/West-facing: 15-20% less production
* Shaded roof: Might lose 30-50% production

**To produce 15,500 kWh/year:**
* 15,500 ÷ 1,250 kWh per kW = **12.4 kW system needed**

Round up to 13 kW to account for:
* System losses (inverter efficiency, wire resistance, etc.)
* Panel degradation over time (0.5% per year)
* Cloudy days
* Winter production shortfall

### Step 3: Panel Count & Roof Space

**Modern solar panels:** 400-450 watts each

**13 kW system:**
* 13,000 watts ÷ 400 watts per panel = **33 panels**

**Roof space needed:**
* Each panel: ~18 sq ft
* 33 panels × 18 sq ft = **594 sq ft of usable roof space**

Do you have 600 sq ft of south-facing, unshaded roof?

* Typical 2,000 sq ft home has 1,000-1,500 sq ft total roof area
* Need ~40% of that to be solar-suitable
* Most homes can accommodate this

If you don't have enough south-facing roof:
* Split between south and east/west (slight production loss)
* Use higher-efficiency panels (450W instead of 400W = fewer panels needed)
* Consider ground-mount if you have yard space

### Step 4: Seasonal Production Reality

This is critical and rarely explained:

**Summer production (May-August):**
* 13 kW system might produce 1,500-1,800 kWh/month
* Your heat pump uses minimal heating
* You're producing **excess** (exports to grid)

**Winter production (November-February):**
* Same 13 kW system might produce 700-900 kWh/month
* Your heat pump is running for heating
* You're pulling from grid to make up difference

**Annual net:**
* Produce: ~16,000 kWh/year
* Consume: ~15,500 kWh/year
* Net excess: 500 kWh/year (slight overproduction)

This is by design.

You size solar to balance annually, not monthly.

Summer excess credits offset winter grid usage (if your utility has net metering—we'll cover this).

## Net Metering in Maryland: How It Actually Works

**Net metering = the utility credits you for excess solar production**

**Maryland Net Metering Rules (2024-2025):**

**Systems under 25 kW (most residential):**
* Utility credits you at **retail rate** for excess production
* Example: Electricity costs $0.14/kWh
* Your solar produces excess: You get $0.14/kWh credit
* Use that credit later when you need grid power

**How credits work:**

**Summer month:**
* Produce: 1,700 kWh
* Consume: 1,000 kWh
* Excess: 700 kWh
* Credit: 700 kWh × $0.14 = $98 banked

**Winter month:**
* Produce: 800 kWh
* Consume: 1,400 kWh
* Deficit: 600 kWh
* Use banked credit: 600 kWh × $0.14 = $84 from summer

**Annual true-up:**
* At year end, utility settles the account
* If you have excess credits remaining, they either:
  * Roll over to next year (most MD utilities)
  * Pay you at wholesale rate (much lower, ~$0.03/kWh)

**Why this matters for sizing:**

If you produce way more than you consume, excess credits get paid at wholesale rate (you lose 75% of value).

If you underbuild, you still pay retail for grid power.

**Sweet spot:** Size to produce 95-105% of annual consumption.

## Battery Storage: The Game-Changer

Net metering is great, but it has limitations:

❌ You're still dependent on grid (outages kill your solar)  
❌ You're vulnerable to future rate changes or net metering policy changes  
❌ You can't optimize for time-of-use rates  
❌ Peak demand charges still apply (for some commercial/large residential)

**Batteries solve all of this.**

### Battery Basics: What You're Actually Buying

**Capacity (kWh):**
* How much energy the battery can store
* Example: 10 kWh battery can store 10,000 watt-hours
* Typical home uses 30-40 kWh/day total
* Heat pump alone: 10-20 kWh/day in winter

**Power (kW):**
* How much energy the battery can deliver at once
* Example: 5 kW continuous output
* Your heat pump draws 3-5 kW when running
* Whole house might draw 8-10 kW during peak usage

**Depth of Discharge (DoD):**
* How much of the battery you can actually use
* LiFePO4: 80-100% DoD (can use almost all stored energy)
* Lithium-ion: 80-90% DoD
* Lead-acid: 50% DoD (can only use half before damaging battery)

**Cycle Life:**
* How many charge/discharge cycles before capacity degrades
* LiFePO4: 3,000-6,000 cycles
* Lithium-ion: 1,000-3,000 cycles
* Lead-acid: 500-1,000 cycles

## LiFePO4 vs. Lithium-Ion: The Deep Dive

You mentioned you lived off LiFePO4 batteries in your car. Let's talk about why that was the right choice then, and why it's still the right choice for home systems.

### LiFePO4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate)

**Advantages:**

**Safety (HUGE):**
* No thermal runaway (won't catch fire or explode)
* Stable even if punctured or damaged
* No toxic gas release
* Critical for home installation (you're sleeping 20 feet from this battery)

**Lifespan:**
* 3,000-6,000 cycles to 80% capacity
* 10-15 year warranty typical
* Real-world: Can last 20+ years

**Temperature tolerance:**
* Operates -20°F to 140°F
* Better cold weather performance than lithium-ion
* Matters in Maryland basements and garages

**Depth of discharge:**
* Can safely discharge to 0% (though 10-90% is recommended)
* No damage from deep discharge

**Environmental:**
* Iron phosphate is non-toxic
* Easier to recycle than lithium-ion
* No cobalt (ethical sourcing concerns)

**Disadvantages:**

**Lower energy density:**
* Heavier and larger than lithium-ion for same capacity
* 10 kWh LiFePO4 might be 300 lbs
* Doesn't matter for stationary home install

### Lithium-Ion (NMC - Nickel Manganese Cobalt)

**This is what Tesla Powerwall, LG Chem, and most "name brand" systems use.**

**Advantages:**
* Higher energy density (more compact for same capacity)
* Slightly better round-trip efficiency (92-95% vs. 90-93% for LiFePO4)

**Disadvantages:**

**Safety concerns:**
* CAN experience thermal runaway (fire risk)
* Requires sophisticated battery management system (BMS)
* Multiple documented home battery fires (rare, but real)

**Shorter lifespan:**
* 1,000-3,000 cycles typical
* 10-year warranty common
* Faster degradation at temperature extremes

**Cobalt sourcing:**
* Ethical concerns (child labor in Congo)
* Supply chain vulnerability
* Price volatility

## Why LiFePO4 Is the Right Choice for Home Solar + Heat Pump

Your car-living experience makes this obvious:

* **Safety is non-negotiable** - You're putting this in your basement/garage
* **Longevity matters for payback** - System needs to last 15-20 years to justify cost
* **Heat pump load is perfect for LiFePO4** - Moderate power draw, long discharge cycles
* **Maryland temperature swings** - Basement might get to 40°F in winter, garage might hit 90°F in summer

**LiFePO4 handles this better.**

## System Architectures: Grid-Tied vs. Hybrid vs. Off-Grid

### Grid-Tied (No Battery)

**How it works:**
* Solar → Inverter → House + Grid
* Excess goes to grid (net metering credits)
* Grid powers house when solar insufficient

**Pros:**
* Simplest design
* Lowest cost
* Best ROI (no battery expense)

**Cons:**
* No backup power (grid outage = no solar)
* Can't optimize for time-of-use rates
* Fully dependent on net metering policy

**Cost for 13 kW system: $26,000-32,000 installed**

### Hybrid (Battery + Grid Connection)

**How it works:**
* Solar → Battery/Inverter → House + Grid
* Solar charges battery first
* Excess charges battery, then exports to grid
* Battery powers house during outages or peak rate times
* Grid as backup when battery + solar insufficient

**Pros:**
* Backup power during outages (1-2 days typical)
* Can optimize for time-of-use rates
* Still benefits from net metering
* Best of both worlds

**Cons:**
* More expensive (battery adds $10K-18K)
* More complex (more potential failure points)
* Battery degrades over time (will need replacement in 10-15 years)

**Cost for 13 kW solar + 20 kWh LiFePO4: $40,000-52,000 installed**

### Off-Grid (No Grid Connection)

**How it works:**
* Solar → Battery → House
* Battery is only power source overnight/cloudy days
* Backup generator for extended cloudy periods

**Pros:**
* Complete independence
* No utility bills ever
* No exposure to rate increases
* No net metering policy risk

**Cons:**
* Most expensive (need massive battery, backup generator)
* Solar array must be 150-200% of consumption (no grid backup)
* Risk of power shortage during extended cloudy weather
* No selling excess production

**Cost for 13 kW solar + 40-60 kWh battery + generator: $55,000-75,000+**

**Almost never makes sense in Maryland** unless:
* You're building in rural area with no grid access
* Grid connection fee is $30,000+ (happens on large rural properties)
* You're ideologically committed to independence regardless of cost

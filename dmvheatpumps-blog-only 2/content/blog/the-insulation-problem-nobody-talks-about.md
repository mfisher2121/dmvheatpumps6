# The Insulation Problem Nobody Talks About

![Insulation R-Value Chart](/images/blog/diagrams/insulation-r-value-chart.png)

Why a $5,000 insulation investment saves you more than a $15,000 premium heat pump—and how to get it done for free (or close to it).

Here's what almost nobody tells you upfront:
Heat pumps are incredible technology in right conditions. But they're a financial disaster in the wrong ones.
The difference isn't the equipment. It's your house.
This article covers:
* Why insulation matters more than equipment choice
* How to assess what you actually have
* Every available government program for free or discounted weatherization
* How to stack incentives to get work done for $1,000-3,000 instead of $8,000-12,000
* The contractors who don't know about these programs (and why that's a red flag)
* DIY steps you can take while waiting for professional work
* Why mobile homes are actually the perfect use case for heat pumps
* The brutal math showing why poor insulation wastes more money than undersized equipment

## Why This Is the Hidden Problem

Homeowners focus on:
* Equipment choice and features
* Payback periods and monthly savings
* Performance metrics (SEER, HSPF)

They ignore:
* Their home's thermal envelope
* The sequence of work (air sealing BEFORE heat pump)
* How heat pump performance actually changes based on insulation quality

## The Maryland Housing Stock Reality

About 60% of Maryland homes built before 1980.
Here's what that typically means:
* Minimal attic insulation (R-11 to R-19)
* Often zero wall insulation
* Single-pane windows
* No air sealing
* Basements/crawlspaces uninsulated

The impact on heat pump performance:
* Poorly insulated homes lose heat 3-4x faster than well-insulated homes
* Same heat pump works harder
* Higher backup heat reliance
* Reduced efficiency (2.0-2.5 COP vs. 3.0-3.5 COP)
* Higher operating costs ($1,000-2,000/year vs. $630/year)
* Shorter equipment lifespan (replacing heat pump more frequently)

## EVERY Available Financial Assistance Program (2024-2025)

### Federal Programs

#### 1. Federal Tax Credits (Inflation Reduction Act)
**What it covers:**
* 30% of heat pump equipment and installation costs

1. Buy/install system
2. Keep receipts and documentation
3. Claim credit on Form 5695
4. Receive credit as tax reduction (not refund)

### 2. Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)

**What it is:**
* Federally funded, state-administered
* Provides FREE comprehensive weatherization for income-qualified households

**Who qualifies:**
* Income at or below 200% of federal poverty level
* For Maryland household of 4: Income under $62,400/year

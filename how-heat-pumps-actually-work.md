# How Heat Pumps Actually Work (Without the Sales Pitch)

## Understanding the Technology Before You Spend $15,000

If you're reading this, someone probably told you that you need to get a heat pump. Maybe it's because of Maryland's ZEHES mandate requiring oil furnace conversions by 2029. Maybe your contractor mentioned it. Maybe you're just tired of $400 monthly heating bills.

But here's what almost nobody explains: **what a heat pump actually does, and why it works differently than every other heating system you've ever used.**

Most heat pump content is either:
* Sales pitches from contractors trying to sell you equipment
* Climate advocacy pretending there are no tradeoffs
* Technical manuals written for engineers, not homeowners
* Price comparison articles that use "up to" savings that assume perfect conditions

This is different. No sales pitch. No agenda. Just physics, economics, and honest truth about what works and what doesn't.

## The Mind-Bending Part: Heat Pumps Don't Make Heat

Every heating system you've ever used **creates heat**:
* Gas furnace: Burns natural gas, creates heat
* Oil furnace: Burns heating oil, creates heat
* Electric baseboard: Resistance coils create heat
* Wood stove: Burns wood, creates heat

Heat pumps don't do any of that.

Instead, they **move heat from one place to another.**

Think of it like a refrigerator running in reverse:
* **Refrigerator**: Takes heat from inside box, dumps it into your kitchen (that's why the back of your fridge is warm)
* **Heat Pump (heating mode)**: Takes heat from outside air, dumps it into your house
* **Heat Pump (cooling mode)**: Takes heat from inside your house, dumps it outside (it's an air conditioner)

Same machine. Same components. Same refrigerant. Just reverses direction.

That's why modern heat pumps replace both your furnace AND your air conditioner. One system does both jobs.

## Why This Matters: Efficiency

Creating heat takes a lot of energy.
Moving heat takes way less energy.

The numbers:
* Gas furnace: 95% efficient (you get 95 BTUs of heat for every 100 BTUs of gas you burn)
* Electric resistance heat: 100% efficient (every watt of electricity becomes a watt of heat)
* **Heat pump: 200-400% efficient** (you get 2-4 watts of heat for every 1 watt of electricity you use)

That "over 100%" efficiency is real.
It's called **COP (Coefficient of Performance).**
* COP 3.0 = 300% efficient (3 kW heat output per 1 kW electricity input)
* COP 1.0 = 100% efficient (electric resistance heat)

The difference isn't magic. You're using electricity to **concentrate heat** that already exists in the air, rather than converting electricity directly into heat.

## How It Works: The Physics Explained

The refrigerant inside a heat pump boils at extremely low temperatures. R-410A (common refrigerant) boils at around -60°F.

Even at 20°F outside, that air is still 80 degrees warmer than the refrigerant's boiling point. So the refrigerant absorbs that energy and evaporates.

The compressor then pressurizes that refrigerant vapor, which concentrates heat and raises the temperature to 120-140°F.

That hot refrigerant flows through your indoor coil and releases heat into your house.

Then it expands back to a lower temperature and goes outside to repeat the cycle.

**You're not creating heat. You're concentrating it.**

This is why heat pumps are so much more efficient than furnaces—even the best gas furnaces can't match the physics of heat concentration.

## The Two Main Types of Heat Pumps

### Air-Source Heat Pumps (What You're Probably Getting)

Extracts heat from outdoor air.

**Ducted (Central System):**
* Connects to existing ductwork
* Replaces traditional furnace + AC
* One outdoor unit, air handler in basement/attic
* Best if you have existing ducts

**Ductless Mini-Split:**
* No ductwork needed
* Indoor wall units in each room
* One outdoor unit serves multiple indoor heads
* Perfect for additions, old homes without ducts, zone control

**Pros:**
* $8,000-15,000 installed
* No excavation needed
* Fast installation (1-3 days)
* Easier permitting

**Cons:**
* Efficiency drops in extreme cold (but we'll cover this in detail)
* Outdoor unit visible and audible
* May need backup heat in coldest weather (Maryland rarely needs this)

### Ground-Source Heat Pumps (Geothermal)

Extracts heat from underground instead of air.

**How it's installed:**
* Vertical loops: Drill 150-400 feet deep (like a water well)
* Horizontal loops: Dig trenches 6-8 feet deep
* Pond loops: Submerge coils in pond or lake

**Pros:**
* Incredibly efficient: COP of 3.5-5.0 year-round
* No outdoor unit (everything underground or in mechanical room)
* Quieter operation
* Ground loop lasts 50+ years

**Cons:**
* $20,000-40,000 installed (2-3x cost of air-source)
* Requires land area or drilling access
* Longer installation time
* Payback period: 15-25 years vs. 5-8 for air-source

For most Maryland homeowners, air-source makes more financial sense unless you have ideal conditions for geothermal.

## Cold Weather Performance: The Honest Truth

Here's what salespeople won't tell you:

Heat pumps don't suddenly "stop working" at a magic temperature. They gradually become less efficient as it gets colder outside.

But "extreme cold" means different things to different systems, and Maryland winters are manageable for modern equipment.

**Real Maryland winter temperatures:**
* December: 25-30°F
* January: 20-25°F  
* February: 22-27°F
* Cold snaps (5-15°F): Happen ~5-10 days per winter
* Extreme cold (below 5°F): Maybe 1-3 days per winter, some years not at all

**Modern cold-climate heat pump performance:**
* **Effective down to 5°F to -5°F**
* Still operating at reduced capacity down to -15°F to -25°F (depending on model)
* Backup heat rarely needed in Maryland climate

Even at its worst in Maryland winters, cold-climate heat pumps deliver **200-250% the efficiency of electric resistance heat**.

The "struggling" you hear about from neighbors with 20-year-old systems? That's old technology talking.

## When Backup Heat Actually Makes Sense

**The #1 objection to heat pumps**: "But what happens when it gets really cold?"

Usually followed by stories of neighbors freezing all winter because their heat pump "doesn't work."

Here's reality:

### Cold-Climate Heat Pumps Never Really "Stop Working" in Maryland

95% of winter, your cold-climate heat pump is operating at 80-100% efficiency with **no backup heat needed.**

The 5% of winter when it might need a little help on the absolute coldest nights of the year.

### What Actually Triggers Backup Heat

1. **System is undersized** for your home's heat loss
2. **Extreme cold snap** beyond design conditions (below 0°F)
3. **Defrost cycles** every 15-20 minutes on humid days (normal operation)
4. **Poor insulation** (heat pump can't keep up with heat loss)

**What this looks like:**
* Heat pump runs continuously trying to maintain temperature
* Indoor temperature might drop 1-3°F below setpoint
* Backup heat may kick in to bridge the gap
* Your electric bill is higher than usual for that day
* As soon as temperature rises above 15-20°F, heat pump catches up again

This is not a system failure. This is expected behavior on the coldest 2-3 days of the year.

## Backup Heat Options: Smart Strategy

### Option 1: Electric Resistance Heat Strips (Most Common)

**How it works:** Electric heating coils installed in your air handler. Automatically kicks in when outdoor temp drops below threshold (typically 20-25°F, adjustable).

**Pros:** Simple, reliable, no separate system needed, automatic operation.

**Cons:** Extremely expensive to run (100% efficient vs. 200-400% for heat pump). 10-15 kW load (major electrical draw).

**Cost impact:** If backup heat runs 10 hours during a cold snap: 150 kWh × $0.14 = $21 for one day. If this happens 5 days per winter: $105/year in backup heat costs.

**When this makes sense:** You have minimal cold days and a well-insulated home.

## The Sizing Question: Rules of Thumb vs. Reality

**Bad advice:** "400 sq ft per ton" (leads to undersizing in leaky homes)

**Good advice:** Manual J load calculation (industry standard). If your contractor doesn't do one, they're guessing.

**Example from our data:**
* 2,000 sq ft townhouse, poor insulation
* "Rule of thumb" sizing: 5 tons (2000/400)
* Manual J calculation: 3.5 tons (actual heat loss)
* Cold-climate 3.5-ton system performed perfectly at 8°F outdoor
* Oversized 4-ton system would have worked fine too, but would be less efficient

**The lesson:** Slight oversizing isn't terrible for cold climates. It provides more capacity on the coldest days when you need it most.

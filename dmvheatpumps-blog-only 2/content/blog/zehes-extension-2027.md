# Maryland ZEHES Funding Extended Through 2027—What You Need to Know

Maryland's Zero Emission Home Electrification and Standards (ZEHES) program just got a critical lifeline. Initially set to expire in 2026, the Maryland Energy Administration announced a 12-month extension with **additional funding to support the state's 180,000 heat pump conversion goal by 2029**.

This is excellent news for homeowners planning electrification projects—but it also means **the clock is ticking faster than ever**. Here's what the extension means for your timeline and budget.

## What Changed?

![ZEHES Timeline and Extension](/images/blog/infographics/zehes-timeline-graphic.png)

**Original ZEHES timeline:**
- Launch: July 2023
- Initial funding: $30 million
- Deadline: December 31, 2026
- Goal: 180,000 conversions by 2029

**Updated timeline (December 2024 announcement):**
- Extended deadline: December 31, 2027
- Additional funding: $15 million (total $45 million)
- Expanded contractor network (150+ certified installers statewide)
- New income tiers for bonuses

---

## Rebate Amounts Remain Strong

**Standard ZEHES rebates (unchanged):**
- Up to **$8,000** for heat pump installation
- Additional **$2,000** for electrical panel upgrades
- **$500 bonus** for low-income households (<80% AMI)
- Sales tax exemption on equipment

**Stacking with other incentives:**
- Federal 30% tax credit (up to $2,000)
- Pepco/BGE utility rebates ($300–$1,200)
- County-level bonuses (Frederick, Howard add $500–$1,000)

**Total potential savings: $10,000–$13,000** on a typical $15,000 heat pump installation.

## Why the Extension Matters

### 1. **Installer Capacity Was the Bottleneck**

Maryland's aggressive 180,000-unit goal created unprecedented demand. In 2024, average wait times for ZEHES installations hit **8–12 weeks** in Montgomery and Prince George's counties. The extension gives:

- More time for contractors to scale teams
- Opportunity for homeowners who missed 2024–2025 booking windows
- Breathing room for permitting backlogs in high-demand jurisdictions

### 2. **A2L Transition Timing**

The extension through 2027 perfectly aligns with the **A2L refrigerant transition**. All new heat pumps sold after January 1, 2025 use R-32 or R-454B refrigerants, requiring:

- Updated contractor certifications (EPA 608 + A2L manufacturer training)
- Leak detection equipment for certain installations
- 2024 IMC code compliance

**The sweet spot:** Late 2025 through mid-2027, when A2L supply chains stabilize, contractor training matures, and installation costs normalize.

### 3. **Economic Uncertainty Buffer**

With potential federal policy changes in 2025–2026, Maryland's extension provides **state-level certainty** for electrification incentives. Even if federal Inflation Reduction Act rebates face cuts, ZEHES remains funded through 2027.

## Who Should Act Now vs. Wait?

### **Replace in 2025 if:**

- Your oil/propane system is **12+ years old**
- You're already planning electrical upgrades (panel, wiring)
- You live in **high-demand counties** (MoCo, PG, Howard, Baltimore County)—book early before summer rush
- You want to lock in **current contractor pricing** (labor costs rising 5–8% annually)

### **Wait until 2026–2027 if:**

- Your current system is **<10 years old** and running efficiently
- You're saving for the 20–30% co-pay after rebates
- You prefer to see **A2L installations mature** (more contractor experience, proven reliability)
- You're coordinating with **other home upgrades** (roof, insulation, windows)

## How to Maximize Your ZEHES Benefits

### Step 1: Confirm Eligibility

**Required criteria:**
- Maryland homeowner (primary residence)
- Replacing oil, propane, or electric resistance heat
- Installing cold-climate heat pump (HSPF2 ≥9.5, operates to -15°F)

**Income verification (for $500 bonus):**
- <80% Area Median Income (AMI)
- 2023 tax returns or HUD documentation

### Step 2: Choose the Right System

**Top cold-climate models for Maryland (2025):**

1. **Mitsubishi H2i Hyper-Heating**
   - HSPF2: 10.5–12.0
   - Operates to -13°F
   - $14,000–$18,000 installed

2. **Carrier Infinity with Greenspeed**
   - HSPF2: 10.0
   - 100% heat at 5°F
   - $12,000–$16,000 installed

3. **Bosch IDS 2.0 Ultra**
   - HSPF2: 11.5
   - European engineering, -22°F rated
   - $16,000–$22,000 installed

### Step 3: Pre-Approve Before Installation

**ZEHES application process:**
1. Create account at Maryland Energy Administration portal
2. Upload proof of current heating system (oil tank photo, propane delivery receipt)
3. Get contractor quote with equipment specs
4. Receive pre-approval (typically 5–10 business days)
5. Complete installation within 90 days
6. Submit final documentation + inspection
7. Rebate paid within 6–8 weeks

**Critical:** Pre-approval is **mandatory**. Installations completed before approval are ineligible.

### Step 4: Verify Contractor A2L Certification

**Required credentials (as of January 2025):**
- EPA 608 Universal with A2L supplement
- Manufacturer-specific training (Carrier, Trane, Daikin, Mitsubishi)
- Maryland Home Improvement Commission (MHIC) license
- MEA-approved ZEHES installer (check portal list)

**Red flags:**
- "We can install it first, apply for rebate later" (violates pre-approval requirement)
- No A2L certification proof
- Quotes significantly below market ($8,000–$10,000 for full system = corners being cut)

---

## Realistic Timeline for 2025–2027

**2025 (Current year):**
- **Best availability:** January–March, September–November (avoid summer AC rush)
- **Average lead time:** 6–10 weeks from quote to install
- **Rebate processing:** 6–8 weeks post-installation

**2026:**
- Expect **moderate competition** as homeowners procrastinate before 2027 deadline
- Lead times likely extend to 8–12 weeks in peak seasons
- Consider booking in **fall 2025** for spring 2026 install

**2027:**
- **Deadline pressure** will create end-of-year rush (similar to 2024 solar ITC expiration)
- Book by **June 2027** at latest to ensure completion before December 31
- Rebate processing may slow if MEA gets flooded with last-minute applications

## What Happens After 2027?

Maryland hasn't announced ZEHES continuation beyond 2027, but two scenarios are likely:

### Scenario 1: Program Sunset with Reduced Incentives
- ZEHES phases out as market matures
- Utility rebates (Pepco, BGE) continue at lower levels ($500–$1,500)
- Federal tax credits remain through 2032 (30% ITC)

### Scenario 2: ZEHES 2.0 with New Goals
- Extension through 2030 with **200,000+ conversion target**
- Focus shifts to **low-income households** and multifamily buildings
- Rebates potentially reduced to $4,000–$6,000 (vs. current $8,000)

**Bottom line:** Current ZEHES terms (2025–2027) are likely the **most generous** we'll see. Early adopters capture maximum value.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I apply for ZEHES if I already have central AC but oil heat?**  
A: Yes, as long as you're replacing the oil heating system with a heat pump. Existing AC doesn't disqualify you.

**Q: What if my electrical panel needs upgrading?**  
A: The $2,000 electrical upgrade rebate covers most 100A→200A panel replacements. Get itemized quote separating HVAC and electrical work.

**Q: Do I qualify if I have natural gas heat?**  
A: No, ZEHES only covers oil, propane, and electric resistance conversions. Natural gas conversions aren't eligible (though this may change in future program iterations).

**Q: Can I install a mini-split instead of ducted heat pump?**  
A: Yes, ductless mini-splits qualify if they meet HSPF2 ≥9.5 requirement and serve primary heating load.

**Q: What happens if I move before the system is installed?**  
A: ZEHES rebates follow the property, not the homeowner. New owner can complete installation and claim rebate if pre-approved.

## Take Action Now

**Homeowner checklist:**
1. ✅ Calculate your potential rebate
2. ✅ Request quotes from 3+ A2L-certified installers
3. ✅ Compare equipment options (cold-climate rating, efficiency, warranty)
4. ✅ Submit ZEHES pre-approval application
5. ✅ Schedule installation for off-peak season (avoid summer rush)

**The 2027 extension is your window—don't let it close.** With $8,000+ in rebates, federal tax credits, and the shift to A2L refrigerants stabilizing, 2025–2027 represents the **optimal time** to electrify your Maryland home.

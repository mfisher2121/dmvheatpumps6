# Is Your Home Ready for a Heat Pump? The Honest Assessment

Why some homes love heat pumps and others become money pits

You can buy the most expensive, most efficient heat pump on the market. But if your home isn't ready for it, you're going to be cold, broke, and writing angry reviews about how "heat pumps don't work."

Here's what almost nobody tells you upfront:
Heat pumps are incredible technology in right conditions. They're a financial disaster in the wrong ones.
The difference isn't the equipment. It's your house.
This article will help you figure out which category you're in—before you spend $15,000 finding out the hard way.

## The Fundamental Difference: How Heat Pumps Deliver Heat

Traditional furnace:
* Blasts air at 120-140°F
* Short bursts of very hot air
* Overcomes poor insulation with sheer thermal force
* Cycles on and off
Heat pump:
* Delivers air at 85-100°F
* Longer run times with lower-temperature air
* Relies on continuous, gentle heating
* Needs your house to hold that heat

What this means:
If your house leaks heat faster than a heat pump can deliver it, you're fighting a losing battle.
The furnace could brute-force its way past your terrible insulation. The heat pump can't.

This is not a flaw in heat pump technology. This is physics.

## The Three Critical Factors

### 1. Insulation Quality

Why it matters:
Heat pumps work by maintaining temperature, not constantly overcoming massive heat loss.
If your house loses heat rapidly:
* Heat pump runs constantly trying to keep up
* Never quite gets warm enough
* Electric bill skyrockets
* You're miserable
How to assess your insulation:

**Attic (most important):**
* Look in your attic
* Measure insulation depth
* Minimum acceptable: R-38 (about 10-12 inches of fiberglass)
* Good: R-49 (about 14-16 inches)
* Excellent: R-60+ (about 18+ inches)
If you see exposed joists or less than 10 inches of insulation, stop. Add insulation before heat pump.

**Walls:**
* Harder to assess without infrared camera
* Homes built before 1980: Often have minimal or no wall insulation
* Brick homes: May have no insulation in wall cavity
* Red flag: Feel your interior walls in winter. If they're cold to touch, you have insulation problems.

**Basement/Crawlspace:**
* Check rim joists (where floor meets foundation walls)
* Often completely uninsulated even in newer homes
* Major source of heat loss.

**Quick test:**
* Turn your current heating system off for 30 minutes on a cold day.
* How fast does your house lose temperature?
* Good: Drops 2-3°F in 30 minutes
* Bad: Drops 5-7°F in 30 minutes
* Terrible: Drops 10°F+ in 30 minutes
If you're in "bad" or "terrible" category, weatherize first. Your heat pump will thank you.

### 2. Air Sealing

The invisible problem:
You can have great insulation and still bleed heat if your house isn't sealed.
Every cubic foot of cold air that leaks in requires your heat pump to warm it up.

Common air leak locations:
* Around windows and doors
* Electrical outlets on exterior walls
* Recessed lighting fixtures
* Attic access hatches
* Plumbing and wire penetrations
* Basement rim joists
* Chimney chases

DIY air leak test:
On a windy day, hold a lit incense stick near:
* Window frames
* Door frames
* Electrical outlets
* Baseboards along exterior walls
If smoke blows sideways, you have air leaks.

Why this kills heat pumps:
Every cubic foot of cold air that leaks in requires your heat pump to warm it up.
If you're constantly replacing warm air with cold air, your heat pump never catches up.

Professional blower door test:
* Costs $200-400
* Measures air changes per hour (ACH)
* Good: Under 3 ACH
* Acceptable: 3-5 ACH
* Bad: 5-7 ACH
* Terrible: 7+ ACH
If you're above 5 ACH, seal your house before installing a heat pump.

### 3. Ductwork Condition (If You Have Ducts)

If you're getting a ducted heat pump, your ducts matter more than you think.
Common duct problems:

**Leaky ducts:**
* Typical home: 20-30% of heated air leaks before reaching rooms
* Old homes: Can be 40-50%
* You're heating your attic, basement, or crawlspace instead of living space.

**Undersized ducts:**
* Heat pumps move more air at lower temperature
* Ducts sized for furnace might restrict airflow for heat pump
* Creates inefficiency and strain on equipment.

**Uninsulated ducts:**
* Ducts running through unconditioned space (attic, crawlspace)
* Lose heat before air reaches rooms
* Condensation problems in summer.

How to check:
* Look at exposed ductwork in basement/attic
* Are joints sealed with proper mastic (not just duct tape)?
* Do some rooms get way more airflow than others?
* Do you see visibly disconnected or damaged duct sections?

Warning signs you need duct work:
* Some rooms are always too hot or too cold
* Visibly disconnected or damaged duct sections
* Excessive dust (indicates leaks pulling in attic/crawlspace air)
* Previous HVAC person mentioned duct issues.

## The Pre-1980 Housing Stock Problem

If your home was built before 1980, pay extra attention.
Why that date matters:
1973 oil crisis led to first serious energy codes. Homes built before that often have:

* Minimal attic insulation: R-11 to R-19
* Zero wall insulation
* Single-pane windows
* No air sealing

Maryland housing stock reality:
* About 60% of Maryland homes built before 1980
* These are the homes ZEHES mandate is targeting for oil-to-heat-pump conversion
* These are also the homes least ready for heat pumps.

The right sequence:
1. Air seal (costs $1,000-3,000)
2. Insulate attic to R-49+ (costs $2,000-5,000)
3. Seal and insulate ducts if applicable (costs $1,500-4,000)
4. Then install heat pump (costs $8,000-15,000)
Total investment: $12,500-23,000

Alternative sequence (wrong but common):
1. Install heat pump (costs $12,000)
2. Be cold and miserable all winter
3. Realize house needs weatherization
4. Now spend another $8,000-12,000 on weatherization
5. Total: $20,000-24,000
Plus one miserable winter.

### The Mobile Home / Manufactured Home Situation

Mobile homes are a special case.
The bad news:
* Worst insulation of any housing type (R-7 walls, R-14 roof is typical)
* Thin metal skin conducts heat like crazy
* Often sits on blocks with open crawlspace underneath
* Windows are usually single-pane.

The good news:
* Small space means small heat pump needed
* Can target specific rooms with mini-splits
* Easier to seal air leaks (less surface area)
* Lower total cost for system.

The strategy for mobile homes:
Don't try to heat/cool an entire mobile home with one system.
Use ductless mini-splits for rooms you actually occupy:
* Living room: 9,000-12,000 BTU mini-split
* Bedroom: 9,000 BTU mini-split
* Total cost: $3,000-6,000 installed

Then weatherize:
* Seal obvious air leaks (windows, doors, floor penetrations)
* Add skirting to enclose crawlspace underneath
* Insulate any exposed ductwork under home
* Add plastic film to single-pane windows in winter
* Result: Not as efficient as a well-insulated house, but way better than resistance heat or propane.

### The "Can I Skip Weatherization?" Question

Short answer: Sometimes, but it's risky.
You might be able to skip weatherization if:

✅ Your home was built after 2000
✅ You can verify attic insulation is R-38+
✅ You have double-pane windows
✅ Your ductwork is in good condition
✅ You're not uncomfortable with your current heating system
✅ Current heating bills are extremely high

You absolutely cannot skip weatherization if:

❌ Built before 1980
❌ You can see through attic insulation to joists
❌ You have single-pane windows
❌ Some rooms are always freezing
❌ You see visible duct damage or disconnections
❌ Current heating bills are relatively low

The middle ground:
Many homes need some weatherization but not a complete overhaul.
Prioritize high-impact work:
1. Air sealing (biggest bang for buck, costs $1,000-2,500)
2. Attic insulation to R-49+ (major impact, costs $2,000-4,000)
3. Duct sealing & insulation (if you have ducts) (costs $800-1,500)
4. Rim joist insulation (costs $800-1,500) (medium impact)

Those three things will make most homes heat-pump-ready without needing to replace windows or insulate walls (which is expensive and invasive).

### The Budget Reality

What weatherization actually costs (Maryland averages):
Work | Cost Range | Impact
---|---|---|---
Professional air sealing | $1,000-2,500 | High
Attic insulation to R-49+ | $2,000-5,000 | High
Duct sealing & insulation | $1,500-4,000 | Medium-High
Rim joist insulation | $800-1,500 | Medium
Window replacement | $5,000-15,000+ | Medium (usually not needed)
Wall insulation (blown-in) | $3,000-6,000 | Medium (invasive)
Total for comprehensive package | $5,300-12,000 |

Add heat pump | $8,000-15,000 |

Grand total for complete system | $13,300-27,000 |

But here's the good news:
Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) programs:
* EmPOWER Maryland rebates (varies by utility)
* Federal tax credits (30% of weatherization costs)
* Low-income weatherization assistance (income-qualified)
* Total available incentives can reduce cost by $3,000-8,000+

Net cost after incentives | $5,300-19,000 |

### The Honest Assessment Checklist

Work through this before calling contractors:

**Insulation**
* ✅ Attic has R-38+ insulation
* ✅ Can't see exposed floor joists in attic
* ✅ Walls feel warm (or neutral) to touch in winter
* ✅ Basement rim joists are sealed and insulated
* ✅ House doesn't cool off rapidly when heat is off
* ✅ 200-amp service (or 150-amp minimum)
* ✅ Space in panel for new heat pump circuit breaker
* ✅ No ongoing electrical issues

**Air Sealing**
* ✅ No visible daylight around windows/doors
* ✅ Electrical outlets on exterior walls don't feel drafty
* ✅ House doesn't cool off rapidly when heat is off
* ✅ Attic hatch is sealed and insulated
* ✅ Professional blower door test: Under 3 ACH
* ✅ No obvious places where smoke is blowing sideways

**Ductwork (if applicable)**
* ✅ All rooms get reasonable airflow
* ✅ No visible disconnected or damaged duct sections
* ✅ Ducts in unconditioned space are insulated
* ✅ Duct joints are sealed with mastic (not just duct tape)
* ✅ Ducts sized for your system (not undersized)

**Windows**
* ✅ Double-pane windows (or willing to accept higher bills with single-pane)
* ✅ No broken seals or condensation between panes
* ✅ Frames are in good condition
* ✅ Current heating bills are extremely high

**Electrical**
* ✅ 200-amp service (or 150-amp minimum)
* ✅ Space in panel for new heat pump circuit breaker
* ✅ No ongoing electrical issues

If you checked most of these boxes: Your home is probably ready for a heat pump.

If you checked almost none of these boxes: Stop. Weatherize your home before even thinking about a heat pump. The payback on weatherization alone will be faster than any heat pump investment.
